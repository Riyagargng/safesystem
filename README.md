# Safesystem
Description: The project was based on checking whether a system is a safe-system or not using Banker's Algorithm. The constraints included the need of resources by the processes should be less than or equal to available resources where need is calculated as difference of maximum resources and allocated resources.                                               
Key Technologies: C Language, Linux

Concept: Bankerâ€™s Algorithm
